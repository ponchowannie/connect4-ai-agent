# Connect Four - AI Game Playing

This project implements two AI players for the modified game of Connect Four. 
Each AI player uses a combination of algorithms including minimax with alpha-beta pruning, genetic algorithms for bomb placement, and a breadth-first search algorithm to search for possible moves.
